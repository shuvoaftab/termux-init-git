**Bug Report Template:**
```markdown
**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Termux environment for testing
- Git installed
- Basic shell scripting knowledge

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Click the "Fork" button on GitHub, then:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/termux-init-git.git
   cd termux-init-git
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Edit the scripts
   - Test thoroughly in Termux environment
   - Update documentation if needed

4. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Test init-keys.sh
   ./init-keys.sh

   # Test git-clone.sh (after setting up deploy key)
   ./git-clone.sh

   # Check logs
   cat ~/git-ssh-setup.log
   ```

### Code Style Guidelines

#### Shell Script Best Practices

1. **Use proper shebang**
   ```bash
   #!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash
   ```

2. **Add error handling**
   ```bash
   set -e  # Exit on any error
   
   # Or handle errors explicitly
   if ! command; then
       echo "Error: command failed"
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

3. **Use meaningful variable names**
   ```bash
   # Good
   SSH_KEY_PATH="~/.ssh/id_rsa_git"
   REPO_URL="git@github.com:user/repo.git"
   
   # Avoid
   KEY="~/.ssh/id_rsa_git"
   URL="git@github.com:user/repo.git"
   ```

4. **Quote variables**
   ```bash
   # Good
   if [ -f "$SSH_KEY_PATH" ]; then
   
   # Avoid
   if [ -f $SSH_KEY_PATH ]; then
   ```

5. **Add comments for complex logic**
   ```bash
   # Retry SSH authentication up to RETRIES times
   # This handles cases where GitHub SSH isn't immediately ready
   retry_ssh_check() {
       local attempt=1
       until ssh -T -p 443 git@ssh.github.com 2>&1 | grep -q "successfully authenticated"; do
           # ... implementation
       done
   }
   ```

#### Documentation Style

1. **Use consistent markdown formatting**
2. **Include code examples for all features**
3. **Keep explanations clear and concise**
4. **Add emojis for visual appeal (but don't overuse)**

### Testing Guidelines
